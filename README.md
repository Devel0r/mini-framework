# Introduction 

The Mini-Framework is a lightweight, custom-built framework designed to simplify the development of dynamic web applications. It provides essential tools for managing application state, manipulating the DOM, routing, and handling events, without the need for established libraries like React, Angular, or Vue.

## Let's begin 

1. git clone https://01.kood.tech/git/dpruel/mini-framework.git 
2. Install npm install -g http-server or use Live Server extension to view the project  
3. If you use Live Server just open index.html || If you use node.js and simple http-server ( npm install -g http-server ) go cd todoMVC, and use http-server -c-1
